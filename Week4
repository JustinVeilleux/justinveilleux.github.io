This week I have been trained to use the 3D printers in order to complete the assignment. First a 3D modeling program is needed called Fusion360 this will allow me to create models that can be transferred over to the 3D printers. After downloading Fusion360 I follow the tutorials put forward to allow me to learn the program.
